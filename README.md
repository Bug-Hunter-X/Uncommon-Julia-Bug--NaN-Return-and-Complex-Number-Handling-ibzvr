# Uncommon Julia Bug: NaN Return and Complex Number Handling

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Julia function that can lead to unexpected NaN (Not a Number) returns for Float64 inputs very close to zero, and demonstrates an issue when dealing with complex numbers.

## Bug Description
The original `myfunction` has two main issues:
1.  **NaN Return for Float64:** Due to floating-point precision limitations, if the input `x` is a Float64 and its value is extremely close to 0, the computation of `x^2` might produce a result that's either slightly negative or exactly 0, depending on the rounding.  This leads to inconsistent results and potentially NaN when combined with the `if` condition.
2. **Complex Number Handling:** The original code compares the value of x directly in the if-else condition using `x > 0`. This comparison works correctly only when x is a real number. If x is a complex number, then this condition does not work as expected, since Julia will compare the real parts of complex numbers only. This could lead to incorrect results.

## Solution
The corrected `myfunction` addresses both issues:
1. It explicitly handles the case when the real part of x is 0, thus preventing issues related to small values and floating-point precision.
2. It compares the real part of x with 0, handling complex numbers correctly by examining the real component only to determine the appropriate conditional branch.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `bug.jl` file.
3. Observe the unexpected output for inputs very close to zero.
4. Run the `bugSolution.jl` file.
5. Observe the corrected output.
