```julia
function myfunction(x)
  if x > 0
    return x^2
  else
    return -x^2
  end
  # The error is that if x is of type Float64 and it is very close to 0,
  # the return value might be NaN (Not a Number). This is due to floating-point precision limitations
  # in the computation of x^2 and the subsequent comparison with 0.
  # In this case, it's possible that for very small negative x, x^2 is treated as 0, leading to
  # a return value of 0 instead of a small positive number.
  # Another issue is that if x is complex, the comparison x>0 might not behave as expected
  # because it will compare the real parts only.



  #Corrected code

  function myfunction(x)
    if real(x) > 0
        return x^2
    elseif real(x) <0
        return -x^2
    else
        return 0
    end
  end
